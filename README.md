# Week-1
The project involves building a CNN  to classify images of plastic waste. By training the model on a labeled dataset, it will identify different types of plastic waste to aid in automated sorting and recycling. The goal is to improve waste management efficiency and contribute to environmental sustainability using deep learning techniques.
